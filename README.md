# Approximation Algorithms for CVC

## Thesis of my Math Bachelor Degree

### THE CLASS GRAPH

The class Graph contains all the basic functions that may be needed for graphs. The class Graph also contains a moltitude of more advanced functions for my Bachelor Thesis.

My thesis revolves around finding CVC (connected vertex covers) in graphs. It is an NP-hard problem, but we have 2-approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time, such as the dfs_CVC algorithm. Another algorithm is the GRASP_CVC, which is shown to give better results (that is, smaller CVCs) empirically.

The algorithm GRASP_CVC_star is my improved version of GRASP_CVC (gives better results with same time complexity).

For any further detail read the thesis pdf.
