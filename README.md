# Approximation-Algorithms-for-CVC
Thesis of my Math Bachelor Degree

THE CLASS GRAPH

The class Graph contains all the basic functions that may be needed for graphs.

The class Graph also contains a moltitude of more advanced functions for my Bachelor Thesis.

My thesis revolves around finding CVC (connected vertex covers) in graphs.

The main algorithm for that is called GRASP_CVC.

The algorithm GRASP_CVC_star is my improved version of GRASP_CVC (gives empirically better results with same time complexity).

For any further detail read the thesis pdf.
